# Rigidbody

### **What is a Rigidbody?**
A `Rigidbody` in Unity lets you add real-world physics to your GameObjects. It makes objects move, fall, or be pushed based on forces like gravity and collisions.

### **Key Properties of Rigidbody:**

1. **Use Gravity**  
   This determines if gravity affects your object. If enabled, the object falls when it has nothing underneath. If disabled, it floats like it's in space.  
   - **On:** Object falls when not supported.
   - **Off:** Object keeps moving in the same direction with no gravity.

2. **Mass**  
   The mass of the object affects how much force is needed to move it. It’s measured in kilograms. Heavier objects don’t fall faster than light ones; both fall at the same speed unless drag is involved.  
   - **Higher mass** means it’s harder to move or push the object.
   - **Lower mass** means it's easier to move.

3. **Drag**  
   Drag slows down an object moving through the air, like air resistance.  
   - **0 drag:** The object moves freely with no resistance.
   - **High drag:** The object slows down quickly.

4. **Angular Drag**  
   Angular drag affects how fast an object stops rotating.  
   - **0 angular drag:** No resistance to rotation.
   - **High angular drag:** The object’s rotation slows down.

5. **Is Kinematic**  
   When this is enabled, the object stops reacting to physics. You can still move it manually by changing its position or rotation, but forces like gravity or collisions won’t affect it. This is useful for platforms or animated objects.

6. **Interpolate**  
   This smooths out any lag between the visual movement and the physics calculations. Use it if your object looks like it’s moving in a choppy or jittery way.

7. **Constraints**  
   Constraints restrict the movement or rotation of the object.  
   - **Freeze Position:** Stops the object from moving in a specific direction (X, Y, or Z).
   - **Freeze Rotation:** Stops the object from rotating around specific axes.

8. **Collision Detection**  
   Helps fast-moving objects detect collisions more accurately, preventing them from passing through other objects. Use it for objects moving at high speeds to avoid missing collisions.

### **How to Add a Rigidbody to a GameObject**
1. Select the GameObject in the Unity Editor.
2. In the Inspector, click **Add Component**.
3. Search for "Rigidbody" and add it to the object.

---

### **Accessing the Rigidbody in a Script**
To interact with a Rigidbody in a script:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    Rigidbody m_Rigidbody;

    void Start()
    {
        // Get the Rigidbody component attached to this object
        m_Rigidbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }
}
```

---

### **Rigidbody Methods:**

1. **AddForce**  
   You can use `AddForce` to apply a force to the object and make it move. This is how you can make an object jump or get pushed by something.

   **Example: Make an object jump:**
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;

   public class Example : MonoBehaviour
   {
       Rigidbody m_Rigidbody;
       public float jumpForce = 350f;

       void Start()
       {
           m_Rigidbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
       }

       void FixedUpdate()
       {
           if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
           {
               // Apply force to make the object jump
               m_Rigidbody.AddForce(Vector3.up * jumpForce);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Summary:
- Enter: Triggered once when an object enters the trigger zone.
- Stay: Triggered repeatedly while the object remains inside.
- Exit: Triggered once when the object exits the zone.

---

### **Summary:**
- **Rigidbody** adds real-world physics to your object.
- **Gravity, Mass, and Drag** control how objects move, fall, or slow down.
- **Is Kinematic** disables physics so you can manually control the object.
- Use **AddForce** to apply forces and make your object jump or move.

This should help you understand how to make your objects behave in a realistic way using Unity's Rigidbody system.
