# Variables

### What is a Variable?

Imagine a variable as a labeled box where you store different types of information. You can think of the label as the name of the box, and the type of information you can store in the box depends on the type of variable you choose.

### Types of Variables

Here are some common types of variables and what they store:

1. **int**: Stores whole numbers. For example, 10 or -3.
2. **float**: Stores numbers with decimals. For example, 3.14 or -7.5.
3. **char**: Stores a single character. For example, 'A' or '7'. Single characters are surrounded by single quotes.
4. **string**: Stores a sequence of characters (text). For example, "Hello" or "OpenAI". Strings are surrounded by double quotes.
5. **bool**: Stores a true or false value. For example, `true` or `false`.

### How to Create a Variable

To create a variable, you need to:
1. Choose the type of the variable (like `int` or `string`).
2. Give it a name (like `age` or `message`).
3. Assign a value to it (like `25` or `"Hello"`).

**Syntax:**
```csharp
type variableName = value;
```

- **type**: The type of information the variable will hold (e.g., `int` or `string`).
- **variableName**: The name you give to your variable (e.g., `age`).
- **value**: The actual data you want to store in the variable (e.g., `25`).

### Examples
1. **Storing Text**

   If you want to store someone’s name, you use a `string` type:

   ```csharp
   string name = "Alice";
   ```

   Here’s how you can use this in a program:

   ```csharp
   void Start() {
       print(name); // This will print "Alice"
   }
   ```
2. **Storing a Number**
   If you want to store someone’s age, you use an `int` type:

   ```csharp
   int age = 30;
   ```

   Here’s how you can use this in a program:

   ```csharp
   void Start() {
       print(age); // This will print 30
   }
   ```
3. **Changing a Value**

   You can change the value of a variable after you’ve created it. For example:

   ```csharp
   int score = 10; // Initially 10

   void Start() {
       score = 20; // Now score is updated to 20
       print(score); // This will print 20
   }
   ```

### Other Types of Variables
Here’s how you can declare variables of different types:

```csharp
int myNumber = 7; // An integer, stores 7
float temperature = 23.5f; // A floating-point number with decimals, stores 23.5
char letter = 'G'; // A single character, stores 'G'
bool isHappy = true; // A true/false value, stores true
string greeting = "Hello, World!"; // A string of text, stores "Hello, World!"
```

### Putting It All Together
Here’s a simple program that uses these variables:

```csharp
void Start() {
    int age = 25; // Stores a whole number
    float height = 5.8f; // Stores a decimal number
    char grade = 'A'; // Stores a single character
    bool isStudent = true; // Stores true or false
    string name = "John"; // Stores a text

    print(name); // This will print "John"
    print(age); // This will print 25
    print(height); // This will print 5.8
    print(grade); // This will print 'A'
    print(isStudent); // This will print true
}
```

In summary, variables are like labeled boxes where you store information. You choose the type of box based on what kind of information you want to keep, name the box, and then put the information inside. You can later change the information inside the box if needed.
