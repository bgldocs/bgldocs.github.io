# Inputs

### ***In Unity, these three functions are used to detect different key states:***

- ### **`Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.UpArrow)`**  
   This checks if the **Up Arrow** key is **pressed down** (the moment the key is first pressed).

 Example:
   ```csharp
   if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.UpArrow)) {
       Debug.Log("Key was just pressed down");
   }
   ```

- ### **`Input.GetKey(KeyCode.UpArrow)`**  
   This checks if the **Up Arrow** key is being **held down** (continuously).

 Example:
   ```csharp
   if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.UpArrow)) {
       Debug.Log("Key is being held down");
   }
   ```

- ### **`Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.UpArrow)`**  
   This checks if the **Up Arrow** key is **released**. 

![](/resources/Inputs/released.png)

Example:
   ```csharp
   if (Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.UpArrow)) {
       Debug.Log("Key was released");
   }
   ```

### Summary:
- **`GetKeyDown`**: Triggers once when the key is pressed.
- **`GetKey`**: Triggers while the key is held down.
- **`GetKeyUp`**: Triggers once when the key is released.
