# Unity's UI System

## Systems
As of now Unity has 3 different UI Systems:

- Immediate Mode GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- UI (Hierarchy Based)
- UI Toolkit

Unity has had a tremendous changes in its UI workflow over the past decade, It started with the **[immediate-mode OnGUI](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnGUI.html),** You build your UI inside a script and customize its looks and behaviours. It was great for creating Unity tools and extensions but inefficient for games.

**In the release of Unity 4.6 (2014),** Unity adapted a new UI system ([Unity 4.6 UI Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOX6itCuKOc)). This system stuck with unity for nearly 10 years. It is great for creating video games and is very flexible, but has its drawbacks as well. Mainly the UI being in the same scene-view as the game, so you would have this giant rectangle object floating in space and blocking your scene view.

As of now, Unity is **actively developing a new package called UI Toolkit.** Which in the future would be the replacement for the current UI system ([UI Toolkit Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUXFHAOXhcA)). You can try it out in releases 2021 and after, but the most optimal version is of 2023.3 and after.

### **For this cource we will be using UI (Hierarchy Based), since the new UI Toolkit is still in active development and as such the final product might differ.**

### In the scene we create a Canvas

![Creating a Canvas](/resources/UI/create_canvas.png)

Any UI you would want to render inside a scene would need to be a child of this Canvas. Preferably you should only use one Canvas per scene.


### We create a Text

![Creating a Text](/resources/UI/create_text.png)
A window then would pop-up, press import and after it finishes, close it.
Make sure that the Text created is a child of the Canvas we made.

### UI View

![UI View](/resources/UI/ui_view.png)
Press the 2D button in the Scene window, Then double click the Canvas Element in the Hierarchy.

### Positioning the Text
![Position Text](/resources/UI/position_text.png)
You can position the Text by pressing "T" on your keyboard to switch to the UI Editing Tool, then dragging the text.

### Anchor the Text
![Anchor Text](/resources/UI/anchor_text.png)
Positioning UI Element in a Canvas is based on the distance in pixels between the Element and its Anchor.
An Anchor is the Coordinates on Screen in which the UI Element needs to keep an offset off no matter the change in Screen Dimensions.

### TextMeshPro Component
![Text Component](/resources/UI/text_inspector.png)
You can see that in the Inspector, There are lots of options to tweak.
What we're interested in is the text input field. Here whatever you write, It displays.

We'll manipulating its value in Code.

### Code It
Inside the player movement script, We'll be creating a reference to the TextMeshPro object we just created and then change its text value when we pickup a coin.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using TMPro;
```

We need to first add this line "using TMPro" to the top of the file.

```csharp
public TextMeshProUGUI coinCounterUI;
```

Then we create a reference of a TextMeshProUGUI.

```csharp
private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
    if (other.gameObject.tag == "Coin") {
        coinCounter = coinCouter + 1;
        coinCounterUI.text = coinCounter.ToString();
    }
}
```

Then when we pickup a coin we update the value of UI Element.

![Pick the reference](/resources/UI/text_reference.png)
We shouldn't forget to assign the coinCounter in the inspector to the TextMeshPro Object

## Main Menu
- We start by creating a new Scene and then creating a Canvas.

- Then we create 2 Buttons as children of the Canvas.
![Button Creation](/resources/UI/button_creation.png)

- Position Them Accordingly, and change their text (You can do so by changing the text of their children)
![Position Buttons](/resources/UI/main_menu.png)

### Code It

**We first need to create a new script and attach it to the camera.**

Script Content:
```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using JetBrains.Annotations;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class MainMenu : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject quitbutton;
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }

    public void StartGame() {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(1);
    }

    public void QuitGame() {
        quitbutton.SetActive(false);
    }
}
```
**Notice how we also added to the top of the file a few "using" statements.**
We also need to pay attention that the 2 new functions are both public.

### Attaching the Functions to The Buttons
In order for the "StartGame" and "QuitGame" functions to be called, we need to attach them to the buttons.
If we select the Start button and scroll down in the inspector.

![Start](/resources/UI/start_before.png)
Notice the "On Click()", field.
In this field we can specify a function from a different script to be called whenever the button is clicked.

In order to achieve that:
- Press "+"
- Drag the main camera into the bottom left box
- Click on "No Function"
- Select the Script Name of where you wrote the 2 public functions (MainMenu)
- Choose "StartGame ()"

![After Start](/resources/UI/start_after.png)

Now do the same for the Quit Button, but choose the "QuitGame ()" function instead.

### Adding the MainMenu Scene
Now that you created scenes, How do you transition between them?
Unity Has a Scenes Management system, to access it go to (File -> Build Settings)

![Build Settings](/resources/UI/scenes_management.png)

In the Section (Scenes In Build) We can drag our scenes and order them correctly.
The numbers to the right of the scenes are what we use to transition between the scenes.

```csharp
public void StartGame() {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(1);
}
```

The "1" in here, refers to the index (number) of the Endless Scene in the "Scenes In Build" section.
