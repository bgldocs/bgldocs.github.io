# Functions

### What is a Function?

A **function** is like a small machine in your code that does a specific job. You can turn this machine on whenever you want by calling its name. When you call it, it performs its task, and it might need some information to do its job.

### Types of Functions

### Creating a Function

To create a function, you need to give it a name and tell the computer what it should do. Here's a simple way to create a function:

```csharp
void MyFunction()
{
    // Code to do something goes here
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `MyFunction()` is the name of the function.
- `void` means this function doesnâ€™t give you anything back.

### Calling a Function

To use the function you created, you "call" it by writing its name followed by parentheses. It's like turning on a machine by pressing a button. Here's how you call a function:

```csharp
MyFunction();
```

**Example**

Imagine you want to print a message to the screen when the game starts. You can set this up with a function:

1. **Create the Function:**

   ```csharp
   void MyFunction()
   {
       print("I just got executed!");
   }
   ```

   This function is called `MyFunction` and it will print the message when it's used.

2. **Call the Function:**

   You can call this function inside another function that runs when the game starts, like this:

   ```csharp
   void Start()
   {
       MyFunction();  // This will run the MyFunction function
   }
   ```

   When the game starts, it will print: "I just got executed!"

**Summary:**

- A function is like a mini-program that does a job.
- You create a function by giving it a name and defining what it does.
- You call a function by using its name with parentheses to make it run.
