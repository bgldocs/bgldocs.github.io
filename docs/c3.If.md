# If Statement

### What is an If-Else Statement?

An **if-else statement** helps your code make decisions. It’s like a traffic light that tells your program what to do based on different conditions. 

- **If** the condition is true, it will do one thing.
- **Else** (if the condition is false), it will do something else.

### Basic Structure

Here’s how an if-else statement is written:

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // Code to run if the condition is true
}
else
{
    // Code to run if the condition is false
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`if (condition)`**: This checks if something is true.
- **`{ ... }`**: Inside these curly brackets is the code that runs if the condition is true.
- **`else { ... }`**: This is optional. It runs if the condition is not true.

### Types of If-Else Statements

1. **Simple If Statement**

   Use this when you only want to do something if the condition is true. If the condition is false, nothing happens.

   ```csharp
   public class GameCharacter : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public bool isLowHealth = true;

       void Start()
       {
           if (isLowHealth)
           {
               Debug.Log("Warning: Your health is low!");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - If `isLowHealth` is true, it prints "Warning: Your health is low!"
   - If `isLowHealth` is false, nothing happens.

2. **If-Else Statement**

   Use this when you want to do something if the condition is true, and something else if it is false.

   ```csharp
   public class GameCharacter : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public bool isLowHealth = true;

       void Start()
       {
           if (isLowHealth)
           {
               Debug.Log("Warning: Your health is low!");
           }
           else
           {
               Debug.Log("Your health is fine.");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - If `isLowHealth` is true, it prints "Warning: Your health is low!"
   - If `isLowHealth` is false, it prints "Your health is fine."

3. **If-Else-If Statement**

   Use this when you need to check multiple conditions.

```csharp
   public class GameCharacter : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public bool isLowHealth = true;

       void Start()
       {
           if (isLowHealth)
           {
                Debug.Log("Warning: Your health is low!");
           }else if (isHealthEmpty) {
                Debug.Log("Gameover!!!");
           }
           else
           {
               Debug.Log("Your health is fine.");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

In this example, the else block will now print "Game Over" if the health is not in the excellent or very low range.
***It's important to notice that 'else if()' sits between 'if' and 'else'.***
