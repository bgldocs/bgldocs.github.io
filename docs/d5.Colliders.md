# Colliders

### **Think of Unity colliders like invisible shapes that help your game objects interact with each other in the game world. Imagine you have a ball and a wall in your game. You don’t want the ball to pass through the wall; you want it to bounce off or stop when it hits the wall. Colliders are what make that possible.**

### Here’s a breakdown of the basics:

1. **Collider Components**: 
   - **Box Collider**: Creates a rectangular box shape around your object.
   - **Sphere Collider**: Creates a spherical shape.
   - **Capsule Collider**: Creates a capsule shape (like a cylinder with rounded ends).
   - **Mesh Collider**: Matches the shape of your object’s mesh (more complex and detailed).

2. **Trigger vs. Non-Trigger**:
   - **Non-Trigger Collider**: This type of collider will physically interact with other colliders. For example, if you set up a box collider on a wall, the ball’s box collider will bounce off the wall’s box collider.
   - **Trigger Collider**: This type of collider doesn’t physically interact but can detect when something enters its area. For example, you can use a trigger to detect when the ball enters a specific area and then execute a script (like collecting an item).

3. **Collider Properties**:
   - **Is Trigger**: Determines if the collider is a trigger or a solid object.
   - **Center**: Adjusts the position of the collider relative to the object.
   - **Size/Radius**: Adjusts the dimensions of the collider (like the width of a box or the radius of a sphere).

Colliders are essential for creating realistic interactions in your game, such as collisions, triggers, and physics-based responses.

In Unity, OnCollisionEnter, OnCollisionStay, and OnCollisionExit are functions that detect when two objects with Rigidbody components collide.

1. **`OnCollisionEnter`: Called the moment two objects touch.**
```csharp
   
   void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision) {
       Debug.Log("Collision started");
   }
```

2. **`OnCollisionStay`: Called continuously while two objects are touching.**
```csharp
   void OnCollisionStay(Collision collision) {
       Debug.Log("Still colliding");
   }
```

3. **`OnCollisionExit`: Called when objects stop touching.**
```csharp
   void OnCollisionExit(Collision collision) {
       Debug.Log("Collision ended");
   }
```

### Summary:
- Enter: Happens once when collision starts.
- Stay: Happens repeatedly while colliding.
- Exit: Happens when the collision ends.

**In Unity, OnTriggerEnter, OnTriggerStay, and OnTriggerExit are used with trigger colliders, which don't apply physical forces but detect when objects enter, stay, or leave a trigger area.**

1. **`OnTriggerEnter`: Called when an object enters the trigger.**
```csharp
      void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
         Debug.Log("Object entered the trigger");
      }
```

2. **`OnTriggerStay`: Called while the object remains in the trigger.**
```csharp
      void OnTriggerStay(Collider other) {
         Debug.Log("Object is inside the trigger");
      }
```   

3. **`OnTriggerExit`: Called when the object leaves the trigger.**
```csharp
      void OnTriggerExit(Collider other) {
         Debug.Log("Object exited the trigger");
      }
```
