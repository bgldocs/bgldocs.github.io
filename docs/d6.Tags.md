# Gameobject Tags

### What Are Tags?

In Unity, **Tags** are like labels you can put on your game objects to help identify and organize them. For example, you might use tags to mark objects as "Player," "Enemy," or "Collectible." This makes it easier to find and interact with these objects in your scripts.

### How to Create a Tag

1. **Select the Game Object**:
   - In your Unity scene, select the game object you want to tag. This could be anything, like a character, an item, or an obstacle.

2. **Open the Inspector Window**:
   - Make sure the **Inspector** window is open. If it’s not visible, you can open it by going to **Window → General → Inspector**.

3. **Add a Tag**:
   - In the Inspector window, locate the **Tag** dropdown menu at the top of the game object’s properties.
   - Click on the dropdown menu. You’ll see a list of existing tags.

4. **Create a New Tag**:
   - At the bottom of the dropdown menu, click on **Add Tag...**. This will open the **Tags & Layers** settings in the Inspector window.

5. **Create and Define the Tag**:
   - In the **Tags & Layers** settings, you’ll see a section labeled **Tags**.
   - Click the small **+** button below the list of tags.
   - A new entry will appear in the list. Click on the new entry and type the name of your new tag (e.g., "Collectible").

6. **Assign the Tag**:
   - Go back to the game object you selected.
   - Open the **Tag** dropdown menu again.
   - You should now see the tag you created in the list. Select it to assign it to the game object.

### Example of Using Tags in Code

Tags are often used to determine what kind of object a game object is. For example, you might want to detect when a player character collides with an object tagged as "Collectible."

Here’s a simple example using the `OnTriggerEnter` function in Unity:

1. **Set Up Your Scene**:
   - Create a few game objects and assign them the tag "Collectible."
   - Ensure at least one of the objects has a Collider component set as a trigger.

2. **Create a Script**:
   - Create a new C# script in Unity, name it something like `CollectibleDetector`, and open it in your code editor.

3. **Write the Code**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class CollectibleDetector : MonoBehaviour
{
    // This function is called when another collider enters the trigger collider attached to this game object
    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        // Check if the other object has the tag "Collectible"
        if (other.CompareTag("Collectible"))
        {
            // Print a message to the console
            Debug.Log("Collectible detected!");
            
            // You can also perform actions like destroying the collectible
            // Destroy(other.gameObject);
        }
    }
}
```

4. **Attach the Script**:
   - Attach this script to a game object with a Collider component set as a trigger. This game object will be used to detect collisions with the "Collectible" objects.

### How It Works

- **`OnTriggerEnter`**: This method is automatically called by Unity when another collider enters the trigger collider attached to the game object with this script.
- **`other.CompareTag("Collectible")`**: This checks if the object that entered the trigger has the tag "Collectible."
- **`Debug.Log("Collectible detected!")`**: This prints a message to the console when a collectible is detected.
