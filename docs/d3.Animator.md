### Animator in Unity

**Animator** is a tool in Unity that helps you control and manage animations for characters or objects in your game. It's part of Unity's animation system called Mecanim.

#### Animator Controller

The **Animator Controller** is like a manager for your animations. It keeps track of different animations (like walking, running, jumping) and decides when to switch between them.

- **State Machine**: Think of this as a flowchart for your animations. It shows all the different animation states (e.g., idle, walking) and how they connect to each other.



- **Animator View**: This is where you can see and edit the Animator Controller. You can open it by double-clicking the Animator Controller asset or going to **Window → Animation → Animator**.

#### States

In animation, a **State** represents a specific action or pose. For example, a character might have states for standing, walking, or running.

- To create a state, you can drag and drop an animation clip into the Animator View or right-click to add one.

- A State looks like a long rectangle in the Animator View. When you click on it, you can adjust its settings in the Inspector View:

  - **Motion**: The animation clip that plays in this state.
  - **Speed**: How fast the animation plays.
  - **Speed Multiplier**: A value that changes the speed of the animation.
  - **Motion Time**: Adjusts the time within the animation.
  - **Transitions**: Shows all the ways this state can move to another state.









#### Default State

The **Default State** is the first animation that plays when the Animator Controller starts. It’s automatically set to the first state you add, but you can change it by right-clicking on another state and setting it as the default.

#### Parameters

**Parameters** are like control buttons for your animations. They let you decide when to switch states based on conditions.

- **float**: A number with decimals (e.g., 1.5).
- **int**: A whole number (e.g., 2).
- **bool**: A true/false value.
- **trigger**: A special kind of bool that resets automatically after being triggered.

Here’s a quick code example to show how you might use parameters in Unity:

```csharp
void AnimatorTest()
{
    anim.SetInteger("attack_type", 1);   // Sets the attack type to 1
    anim.SetFloat("move_speed", 0.2f);   // Sets the movement speed to 0.2
    anim.SetBool("is_alive", true);     // Sets the character to be alive
    anim.SetTrigger("jump");            // Triggers the jump animation

    var attackType = anim.GetInteger("attack_type");
    var moveSpeed = anim.GetFloat("move_speed");
    anim.ResetTrigger("jump");          // Resets the jump trigger
}
```

#### Transitions

**Transitions** are the connections between states. They determine how and when to move from one animation to another.

- In the Animator View, transitions are shown as arrows connecting states.
- You can set up a transition by right-clicking on a state and choosing where to transition next.

For each transition, you can set options like:
  - **Has Exit Time**: Whether the transition should only occur after the current animation has played for a certain amount of time.
  - **Fixed Duration**: How long the transition takes.
  - **Transition Duration**: How smoothly the animation blends from one state to another.
  - **Transition Offset**: Where in the new animation the transition should start.
