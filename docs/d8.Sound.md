# Sound

Sound, while often times unfortunately neglected by developers, plays a crucial role in the experience and progression of video games. In this documentation, we'll be taking a brief look on the way Unity handles sounds.

## AudioSource Component
The AudioSource Component is the main way Unity uses to output audio through the computer's speakers. The it's used is by attaching it on the object you would like to emit the sound and then calling it to play in the script.

![Sound Component](/resources/Sound/sound_comp.png)
- AudioClip - is the sound file you'll be playing.
- Mute - mute this AudioSource.
- Play On Awake - Play this AudioSource automatically on play (for background music).
- Loop - to loop this Audio after it finished.
- Priority - over other AudioSources.
- Volume - a volume scaler (0.0 - 1.0).
- Pitch - the speed in which the Audio is being played.
- Stereo Pan - to lean the Audio direction to left or right
- Spatial Blend - 2D is for making the sound come from every direction, 3D to make it come from the direction of the AudioSource Component's position and also to make it fainter based on distance.

***All other options, need not concern yourself with.***

## Play an AudioClip

### Import AudioClip

You can import an audio clip of these types (mp3, wav, ogg) and be able to play them, Unity is able to recognize and assign them to the AudioClip slot in the AudioSource Component.

To add a file, Drag and Drop it in the project section. Then you can assign it to the AudioClip slot from the project section via Drag and Drop, or you press the little circle the right of the slot.

**You can find free audio on [Freesound.org](freesound.org)**, just beware to pay attention to the attribution section to see if you're allowed to use it in your project.

### Play from Script

In the player's script, We need to make a reference to the AudioSource.

```csharp
AudioSource audioSource;

void Start() {
    audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
}
```

After that in the function where we collect a coin, we play the sound.

```csharp
private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
    if (other.gameObject.tag == "Coin") {
        coinCounter = coinCouter + 1;
        coinCounterUI.text = coinCounter.ToString();
        audioSource.Play();
    }
}
```

This will play the AudioClip according to the settings of the AudioSource (AudioClip, Loop, Volume...).

**Alternatively**
You can play an AudioClip directly using the AudioSource without the need to assign it.

First we make a reference to the AudioClip
```csharp
public AudioClip coinSfx;
```

Then we assign it in the inspector.

![](/resources/Sound/coinSfx.png)

Then back in the script we can do this.

```csharp
private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
    if (other.gameObject.tag == "Coin") {
        coinCounter = coinCouter + 1;
        coinCounterUI.text = coinCounter.ToString();
        audioSource.PlayOneShot(coinSfx);
    }
}
```

This is useful for wanting to play multiple AudioClips from the same AudioSource instead of creating a different AudioSource Component for each sound.
This will play the Clip only once.
