# Movement

### What is a Vector3?

*   A Vector3 represents a point or direction in 3D space using three numbers: x, y, and z (for width, height, and depth).
    
*   It is commonly used in Unity to work with 3D positions and directions.
    

### Shortcuts for common directions:

Instead of typing out all the numbers, Unity gives you shortcuts to create specific directions:

*   Vector3.forward: (0, 0, 1) - moves forward in the z direction.
    
*   Vector3.back: (0, 0, -1) - moves backward.
    
*   Vector3.up: (0, 1, 0) - moves up.
    
*   Vector3.down: (0, -1, 0) - moves down.
    
*   Vector3.left: (-1, 0, 0) - moves left.
    
*   Vector3.right: (1, 0, 0) - moves right.
    
*   Vector3.zero: (0, 0, 0) - represents no movement.
    
*   Vector3.one: (1, 1, 1) - a direction with all ones.
    

### Creating a Vector3

To create a Vector3, you can declare it and give it values like this:

```csharp
Vector3 myDirection = new Vector3(2.5f, 8f, 26.3f);
```

You can also declare it first and assign values later:

```csharp
Vector3 myDirection;

void Start() {

myDirection = new Vector3(2.5f, 8f, 26.3f);

}
```

Or, use one of the shortcuts mentioned earlier:

```csharp
Vector3 myDirection;

void Start() {

myDirection = Vector3.up; // This means (0, 1, 0)

}
```

### Moving an Object with Translate

To move a GameObject, we need to change its position. Unity lets us do that by using the Transform.Translate function, which moves an object in a direction.

#### Example:

Move an object forward (along the z-axis) every frame:

```csharp
void Update() { transform.Translate(Vector3.forward);}
```
The problem with this example is that it moves the object too fast because it runs every frame. To slow it down, we can multiply the movement by Time.deltaTime, which makes it move smoothly at 1 unit per second:

```csharp
void Update() { transform.Translate(Vector3.forward \* Time.deltaTime);}
```
### Adding Speed

If you want to control how fast the object moves, you can add a speed factor:

using UnityEngine;public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour { float speed = 5.8f; // This is the speed of the object void Update() { // Move the object forward along its z-axis at 5.8 units/second transform.Translate(Vector3.forward \* speed \* Time.deltaTime); }}

In this example, the object will move forward at a speed of 5.8 units per second.

### Summary

1.  Vector3 is used to represent positions and directions in 3D space.
    
2.  Unity has shortcuts for common directions like Vector3.forward and Vector3.up.
    
3.  Use Transform.Translate to move objects in a direction.
    
4.  Multiply movement by Time.deltaTime to control speed.
    
5.  You can also add a custom speed to control how fast an object moves.
